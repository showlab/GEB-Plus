We introduce a new dataset called **Kinetics-GEB+**. The dataset consists of over 170k boundaries associated with captions describing status changes in the generic events in 12K videos. Upon this new dataset, we propose three tasks (**Boundary Captioning**, **Boundary Grounding** and **Boundary Caption-Video Retrieval**) supporting the development of a more fine-grained, robust, and human-like understanding of videos through status changes.

We evaluate many representative baselines in our dataset, where we also design a new **TPD (Temporal-based Pairwise Difference) Modeling** method for visual difference and achieve significant performance improvements. Besides, the results show there are still formidable challenges for current methods in the utilization of different granularities, representation of visual difference, and the accurate localization of status changes. Further analysis shows that our dataset can drive developing more powerful methods to understand status changes and thus improve video level comprehension.

## Using Kinetics-GEB+ Dataset
In our **Kinetics-GEB+** dataset, each video contains 1 to 8 annotations from different annotators and each annotation consists of several boundaries inside a video, where the boundaries' location are not the same. 
In the evaluation of downstream tasks, we select one annotator whose labeled boundaries are most consistent with others to reduce noise and duplication. Then, we use these boundaries’ timestamps as the anchors to merge other annotators’ captions, preserving the diversity of different opinions. Thus, one video corresponds to multiple boundaries, and each boundary could be with multiple captions. Finally, this selection includes 40k anchors from all videos.

**Here we release 2 versions of dataset:**

a) **Filtered datasets (Recommended)** [[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KlFQO__GuUlue_4uCj5oBzzx357D9WE_?usp=sharing)] used in our paper, which has been adjusted for downstream task, including 40K filtered boundaries.

b) **Raw annotation** [[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZEoqsr9gy4FluRhSQgIBp2NiYWVIhcsQ?usp=sharing)] that could be used as supplement in training your own model, including 170K boundaries.

Note that our paper uses version a) in the evaluation of our model, please also evaluated your own model with version a) in future comparisons.

## Prepare to Use Our Baseline Models

Clone the project to run our baseline models:

`git clone https://github.com/Yuxuan-W/GEB-Plus.git`

Clone our conda environment using:

`conda env create -n ENVNAME --file environment.yml`

Note that the version of `pytorch-transformer` we use is `1.0.0`.

## Task1: Boundary Captioning
![image](https://github.com/Yuxuan-W/GEB-Plus/blob/master/figures/Captioning_res.png)
### Preparing evaluation package
To run Boundary Captioning task, you need to download the **evaluation package** [[Download](https://github.com/LuoweiZhou/coco-caption/tree/de6f385503ac9a4305a1dcdc39c02312f9fa13fc/pycocoevalcap)] and put it under `utils` folder as:

`GEBC/utils/pycocoevalcap`

Note that the evaluation package also requires **Java**, one simple way is to install a light-weight open-jdk on your server if you haven't installed.

### Preparing features
To run Boundary Captioning task, you need to download and unzip the **features** [[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E-KML1rU_gd6CF4nkkNG8Jm3Cq6VBYRR?usp=sharing)], make sure you have the following path:

`GEBC/datasets/features/region_feature`

`GEBC/datasets/features/tsn_captioning_feature`

### Training from scratch
To train on the captioning baseline, execute the following command:

`python run_captioning.py --do_train --do_test --do_eval --ablation obj --evaluate_during_training`

### Testing our trained model
We only provide the checkpoint that generating our highest score in the paper [[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZYR10TyVXtExZwl4Q-L4Wg0UH7V_rCTF/view?usp=sharing)].
Unzip the folder to your project, execute the following command:

`python run_captioning.py --do_test --do_eval --ablation obj --eval_model_dir $YOUR_UNZIPPED_DIR$`

### Performance of our baseline
The best performance of our baseline are achieved by _ActBERT-revised_ with _ResNet-roi+TSN_ feature:

|        | _Subject_  | _Status Before_ | _Status After_ | **Average** |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
|  _CIDEr_ | 85.33  | 75.98 | 62.82 | **74.71** | 
| _SPICE_  | 20.10  | 20.66 | 17.81 | **19.52** | 
| _ROUGE_L_  | 39.16  | 23.70 | 21.60 | **28.15** | 


<br/>

## Task2: Boundary Grounding
![image](https://github.com/Yuxuan-W/GEB-Plus/blob/master/figures/Grounding_res.png)

Like we mentioned in the paper, we use two schemes of frame sampling when proposing the timestamp candidates who might be the answer. By default, we sampled one candidates every 3 frames (0.1s), or we used the baseline of GEBD to generate proposals. Here we provide implementations for both of them.

### Preparing features
To run Boundary Grounding task, you need to download and unzip the **features** [[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E-KML1rU_gd6CF4nkkNG8Jm3Cq6VBYRR?usp=sharing)], make sure you have the following path:

`GEBC/datasets/features/region_feature`

If not using GEBD proposals (By Default), you will need:
`GEBC/datasets/features/tsn_all1s_feature`

If using GEBD proposals, you will need:
`GEBC/datasets/features/tsn_gebd_feature`

### Training from scratch
To train on the grounding baseline, execute the following command:

`python run_grounding.py --do_train --do_test --do_eval --ablation obj --evaluate_during_training` (By Default)

Or if you want to use GEBD proposals in followed validation and testing after training is finished:

`python run_grounding.py --do_train --do_test --do_eval --use_gebd --ablation obj --evaluate_during_training` (Use GEBD)

### Testing our trained model
We only provide the checkpoint that generating our highest score in the paper [[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TcBGDk8y_AXOaiTLbY0kQ5PBws9-o8jn/view?usp=sharing)].
Unzip the folder to your project, execute the following command:

`python run_grounding.py --do_test --do_eval --ablation obj --eval_model_dir $YOUR_UNZIPPED_DIR$` (By Default)

Or if you want to use GEBD proposals in testing:

`python run_grounding.py --do_test --do_eval --use_gebd --ablation obj --eval_model_dir $YOUR_UNZIPPED_DIR$` (Use GEBD)

### Performance of our baseline
